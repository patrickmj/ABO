Hi Tonya!

I forked the project, added this to it, pushed it back to _my_ origin/master for the project, then issued a pull request.

When you accepted the pull request, that's what brought this file into _your_ project.

If I had edited one of the files, like to fix a bug, it would then change what's in your project -- assuming there weren't conflicts between your work and my work! :)
